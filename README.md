| Why I Love Lorde  | Michelle Cao  |  03/05/2021 |

# Introduction

In 2018, I was obsessed with Lorde. She accompanied me on runs, drives, in the shower, and before bed. Homemade Dynamite and Supercut pumped me up, Hard Feelings/Loveless and Liability echoed my shapeless emotions, Ribs and Team brought peace, and Liability and Sober II reflected my sad days. That year, I listened to 93 hours of Lorde, mainly the Homemade Dynamite remix with Post Malone, Khalid, and SZA on repeat.
But, in thinking about why I liked what I liked and what it was about Lorde's music that connected with me, I realized I didn't know the answer to a basic question: was her music happy or sad? NPR described her as minimalistic and dark pop, while this Reddit thread decided her music was "happy sad, kind of like nostalgia." Was it nostalgia I felt, or a happiness that was all in my head?
Before Lorde's next album was released, I wanted to see if I could find an answer. For this analysis, I will be using R to analyze the Pure Heroine and Melodrama albums. For the purposes of this research, I will be ignoring any EP's to prevent duplication.
