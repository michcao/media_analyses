| Why I Love Lorde  | Michelle Cao  |  03/05/2021 |


# Introduction

In 2018, I was obsessed with [Lorde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorde). She accompanied me on runs, on drives, in the shower, and before bed. Her music made me feel alive, reflective, and sentimental all at once. In that year alone, I listened to 93 hours of Melodrama and Pure Heroine.

To this day, one of my most-played songs of all time is Homemade Dynamite â€“ the remix with Post Malone, Khalid, and SZA. Other long-time favorites are Supercut, Green Light, Buzzcut Season, and Perfect Places. 

In thinking about why I like what I like and what it is about Lorde's music that connects with me, I realize that I don't know the answer to a basic question: is her music happy or sad? This [NPR article](https://www.npr.org/2018/08/31/638897130/lorde-is-the-21st-centurys-author-of-adolescent-evolution) described her as minimalistic and dark pop, while this [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/lorde/comments/gojch3/happy_songs/) decided her music as "happy sad, kind of like nostalgia." Was it nostalgia I felt, or a shapeless emotion that was all in my head?

Before Lorde's next album is released (~ hopefully soon ~), I wanted to see if I could find an answer to the first question. For this analysis, I will be using R to analyze the Pure Heroine and Melodrama albums. For the purposes of this research, I will be ignoring any EP's to prevent duplication.
